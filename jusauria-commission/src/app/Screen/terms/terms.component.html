            <h3>Payment Timelines and Consequences</h3>
            <ul>
                <li class="text-decoration-underline">
                    Payment: PayPal or Amazon Gift Cards from either amazon.com or amazon.de.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In the event that I am unable to complete your commission within the agreed-upon timeframe, I will promptly notify you. You can then choose to grant me more time or request a 75% refund.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In case of not being able to pay right away following steps will take place:
                    <ol>
                        <li>After notifying you are not able to pay you will get a period of 1 week to gather the money</li>
                        <li>Following the one-week grace period, a warning is issued and another 1 week period</li>
                        <li>Failure to pay within the one-week period results in an additional 10% fee and another 1 week period</li>
                        <li>After the week period the commission will be automatically cancelled. Anything which got created in this commission belongs to me 100%.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>
                    It's possible to request a payment plan before starting a commission. Failure to meet the payment deadlines will result in above measures being taken until the payment is completed or the commission is canceled.

            <ul>
                <li>
                    I'll start working on your commission once I receive 50% or more of the set price.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you're not fully satisfied upon completion, we don't offer full refunds. However, you can get a 45% refund, but you'll lose the shared copyright of the drawing.
